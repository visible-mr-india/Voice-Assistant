# Voice-Assistant
The only voice assistant with less patience than your ex. This AI-powered smartass doesn't just answer your questions; it roasts your intelligence while doing it. Powered by Deepseek R1’s 8-billion-freaking-parameter model, this bad boy knows more than you, your friends, and Google combined – and it’s not afraid to remind you.

What makes this an absolute menace?

Smart as hell: Runs on Deepseek R1 (8B), so yeah, it’s basically a walking (talking?) encyclopedia – except it has no filter.
Sarcasm Mode: Always On™ – Whether you're asking for directions or life advice, expect a response dripping with condescension.
Voice Control? Yeah, duh. Talk to it, yell at it, whisper your secrets – it doesn’t care
Insult Generator™: Because motivation through bullying is definitely a thing.
Endless Roast Capabilities: It will call you out for your late-night fridge raids and 5-hour TikTok spirals.
Installation- Alright, dumbass. Here’s how you install and use this sarcastic, foul-mouthed genius. Follow these steps exactly unless you want me to laugh at your incompetence.

Step 1: Download the Files Get the full project folder from GitHub. Extract the ZIP file if needed. (Yes, even this basic step is necessary for some of you.)

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Step 3: Run the Damn Thing Double Click and Run The File

Step 4: Enjoy Getting Roasted by Your Own AI Ask it dumb questions. Let it tell you how much of a disappointment you are (with love, of course).

Uninstalling (If You Can’t Handle the Heat)

If you’re too weak for this AI’s attitude, simply delete the folder. That’s it. But deep down, you’ll miss it.
